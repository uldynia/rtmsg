      "So why call yourself ''The Dragon''? Why not
      ''Dragon Prime'' or ''Dragon Level 3''?

      The Dragon had made just one
      friend over the years, who believed It wasn''t the cold monster others had
      made it out to be.

      "Because it''s short, simple, straight to the point,
      and elegant."'
